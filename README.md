# BucketQueue
This queue behaves like a bucket queue if the number of costs tends to zero compared to the number of elements in the queue.

BucketQueue's operations are the same as std::priority_queue's (a structure in C++) with the only difference BucketQueue operations start with cappital letters.
BucketQueue's operations O(time) tend to O(1).
